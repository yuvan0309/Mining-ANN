Excellent — let’s go step-by-step in detail for Bishop’s Simplified Method incorporating pore pressure (Ru), exactly as used in Rocscience Slide2 (2D) for slope stability analysis.

⸻

🧭 1. Overview

Bishop’s Simplified Method is one of the most widely used limit equilibrium methods (LEM) to calculate the Factor of Safety (FoS) of circular slip surfaces in slopes.

It assumes:
	•	Circular slip surface (circular arc failure).
	•	Inter-slice forces are horizontal (no shear between slices).
	•	Force equilibrium in vertical direction.
	•	Moment equilibrium about the center of the circle.

It’s a statistically correct iterative method—the FoS is computed iteratively since it appears on both sides of the equation.

⚙️ 2. Basic Assumptions and Notation

For each slice i:

Symbol	Description
W_i	Weight of slice
\alpha_i	Angle between slice base and horizontal
c’	Effective cohesion
\phi’	Effective friction angle
N_i	Normal force on the base
U_i	Pore pressure force at base
l_i	Base length of the slice
R	Radius of slip circle
r_u or R_u	Pore pressure ratio
F	Factor of Safety

💧 3. Pore Pressure Ratio (Ru) Concept

In Slide2, pore pressure can be modeled directly via Ru (pore pressure ratio), defined as:

r_u = \frac{u}{\gamma H}

or for each slice base:

U_i = r_u \, W_i

(approximately, where W_i is slice weight and r_u expresses pore pressure as a fraction of total overburden).

If Ru is applied, the effective normal stress on the base becomes:

N’_i = N_i - U_i

⸻

🧮 4. Bishop’s Simplified Method Formula

(a) Slice Equilibrium

For each slice, the resisting shear strength (mobilized) is:

S_i = \frac{1}{F} (c’ l_i + N’_i \tan \phi’)

Vertical equilibrium gives:

N_i = W_i \cos \alpha_i + \frac{(S_i) \sin \alpha_i}{F}

Combining and substituting, Bishop derived an expression that includes F on both sides.

⸻

(b) Bishop Simplified Equation

The factor of safety (F) is computed from:

F = \frac{\sum \left[ c’ l_i + (W_i - U_i l_i) \tan \phi’ \right] \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{\tan \alpha_i \tan \phi’}{F} \right)} }{\sum W_i \sin \alpha_i}

This is the iterative Bishop simplified equation, incorporating pore pressure (U), which can be computed using Ru.

⸻

🧩 5. Expressing U in terms of Ru

If U_i = r_u W_i, substitute this in:

F = \frac{\sum \left[ c’ l_i + (W_i - r_u W_i) \tan \phi’ \right] \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{\tan \alpha_i \tan \phi’}{F} \right)} }{\sum W_i \sin \alpha_i}

or simplifying:

F = \frac{\sum \left[ c’ l_i + W_i (1 - r_u) \tan \phi’ \right] \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{\tan \alpha_i \tan \phi’}{F} \right)} }{\sum W_i \sin \alpha_i}

This is the Bishop Simplified with Ru formula used in Rocscience Slide2 when the pore pressure ratio option is selected.

⸻

🔁 6. Iterative Solution Procedure
	1.	Assume an initial F = 1.0.
	2.	Compute the right-hand side (RHS) using the equation above.
	3.	Update the new F = RHS.
	4.	Repeat until F converges (difference < 0.001).

This iteration is what Slide2 does automatically.

⸻

📘 7. Simplified Example Form

If you neglect interslice forces and small-angle effects:

F = \frac{\sum [c’ l_i + (W_i - U_i l_i) \tan \phi’] \cos \alpha_i}{\sum W_i \sin \alpha_i}

But this simplified moment method is less accurate — Slide2 uses the full Bishop iterative form above.

⸻

🧱 8. Implementation in Slide2 (Rocscience)

In Slide2, you can set:
	•	Method → “Bishop Simplified”
	•	Pore Pressure → “Ru Coefficient”
	•	Then specify Ru value (e.g., 0.2 or 0.3 depending on groundwater level).

Slide2 automatically:
	•	Calculates pore pressure at each slice base: U_i = r_u \gamma H_i l_i
	•	Applies it in the effective normal stress term
	•	Iterates until convergence of FoS.

⚠️ 9. Notes and Practical Values

Material	Typical Ru range
Dry slope	0.0
Damp soil	0.1 – 0.2
Saturated slope	0.3 – 0.5
Fully submerged	0.5 – 1.0

✅ 10. Final Bishop Simplified with Ru Formula (as in Slide2)

\boxed{
F =
\frac{
\sum_i \left[
c’ l_i + (W_i - r_u W_i) \tan \phi’
\right]
\frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{\tan \alpha_i \tan \phi’}{F} \right)}
}{
\sum_i W_i \sin \alpha_i
}
}

Would you like me to show a numerical example (with assumed slice data) demonstrating the iteration steps exactly as done in Slide2? It helps visualize how F converges.
